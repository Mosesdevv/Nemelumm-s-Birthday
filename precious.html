      "Happy Birthday Chinny Babyyyyyy
I love how your birthday always starts off the new year for me😂. You're twennyy twoo, you're always launching ages for me. My selfless queen. I truly appreciate you Chinny. It's not like you're the perfect person but when it comes to true kindness, you're a great example. You go out of your way for a lot of people even when they're not your closest friends and if there's one person I've learnt about understanding people's sides from, it's you. I pray in this year that God favours you and helps you achieve your heart's desires. I pray adulthood is kind to you. I pray you find joy in your life and relationships and I pray that you begin to make money that shocks even you. I love you my queennnn and I'm grateful I met you and kept you from 100 level and even till now. Have a great birthday 😚😚❤️
P.S: Moses did good o, boyfriend of the year award is coming 😂🩷"
