    <div class="wish">
      "Happy birthday to the kindest human I know. Your smile is one of the most beautiful things I have seen, and your small gap tooth is just perfect; these and many other things about you make me understand that God definitely has favourites because he took his time moulding you. I pray that you get sevenfold of the love you give to people and are always joyful. I pray that your path shines brighter and brighter. I pray that good things come to you with so much ease. I love you! so so much...more than I love watching cooking videos. God bless you."
