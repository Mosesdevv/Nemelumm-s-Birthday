      "Happy birthday to the kindest human I know. Your smile is one of the most beautiful things I have seen, and your small gap tooth is just perfect; these and many other things about you make me understand that God definitely has favourites because he took his time moulding you. I pray that you get sevenfold of the love you give to people and are always joyful. I pray that your path shines brighter and brighter. I pray that good things come to you with so much ease. I love you! so so much...more than I love watching cooking videos. God bless you."

      "My Chinchin, My Queen and favorite Princess
I love you my babyyyyüíï
You‚Äôve been nothing short of a ray of sunshine in my life. Though we‚Äôre not the closest your love makes it impossible not to admire you. You‚Äôre such an effortlessly loveable person, and you radiate beauty both inside and out.
I love how we bonded in our final year both with sharing the same project supervisor and sitting so close in class. 
Those moments made  me know you better, and it was clear that you‚Äôre a truly exceptional soul. Your hugs, I love it and you always, always leave me feeling comforted and cared for
You have such a heart overflowing with love, and an aura that brings joy to everyone around you.
  Truly you are perfect to me. Trust me
My prayer for you, my Chinchin, is that your path continues to shine brighter and brighter. That you find Joy and peace in the presence of the Lord. I pray that you continue to walk in Gods light always and have such a wonderful relationship with Jesus. May God grant you unending joy and the fulfillment of every desire in your heart
May you always be surrounded by love as you so freely give it, and may His grace be sufficient for you in all that you do.
I wish you nothing but the absolute best in life with success that knows no bounds, peace that surpasses all understanding, You deserve it all, my queen, my princess, my wonderful friend.
In Jesus name. Amen.
I LOVE YOU SOO MUCH JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE YOU üíï  "
